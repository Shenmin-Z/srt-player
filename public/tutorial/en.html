    <h1>SRT Player Tutorial</h1>

    <h2>0. What's this tool for</h2>
    <p>
      This tool is designed for language learners. Its has 2 main features:
      <span class="text-blue">separate subtitle</span> and <span class="text-blue">waveform</span>.
    </p>
    <p>Separate subtitle means you can copy and paste to look up new words.</p>
    <p>Waveform helps practising listening.</p>

    <h2>1. Import files</h2>
    <img src="/tutorial/import.webp" id="demo-import" />
    <ul>
      <li>
        What to import
        <ul>
          <li>video/audio files (appears on left)</li>
          <li>subtitle files (appears on right)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Supported format
        <ul>
          <li>
            Video and audio depends on your browser, you can check it
            <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Subtitle: <span class="text-blue">srt, ssa, ass</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If you import multiple videos and subtitles, their orders need to match. You can drag items to reorder.</li>
      <li>It's OK to import only one video/audio</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Subtitle</h2>
    <p>Check the subtitle settings panel. (press <b class="text-blue">B</b> and it will show up)</p>
    <p>
      Videos and subtitles found on Internet may not match time-wise, and you'll have to adjust subtitle delay. This can
      be easily done by clicking on the timestamp like <span style="color: #a6e22e">00:00:44,478</span> or
      <span style="color: #f92672">00:00:46,713</span>, and delay will be adjusted to the current video time. If delay
      is set, it will be shown under the cc icon in red on top right.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Waveform</h2>
    <h3>Generating waveform</h3>
    <p>Press <b class="text-blue">S</b> to bring up waveform control.</p>
    <p>By default waveform is disabled. To enable waveform, there are 2 options:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Generate from the current video/audio file</li>
      <li>Generate from a separate file</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Most of the time option 1 is enough. But for technical reasons, the generated waveform might not be accurate, in
      which case you'll have to choose option 2 and feed browser a separate file with format that's easier to digest.
    </p>
    <p>For example, you can convert the video file to a mp3 file, and use that mp3 file to generate waveform.</p>
    <h3>Interact with waveform</h3>
    <p>Click on the waveform will:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>set video to the corresponding time</li>
      <li>set a replay location, indicated by a <span style="color: #e6d874">yellow</span> line</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Press <b class="text-blue">R</b> or click the replay icon(bottom right of video) to replay from the previously set
      location
    </p>
