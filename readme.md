### What's wrong with normal video player?

Nothing is wrong, it's just that in certain situations, you want to:

- see the full context
- copy & paste subtitle content
- adjust subtitle delay
- pinpoint in the timeline and replay from there

With normal video players it may not be very convenient to do these.

## Features

### Subtitle

- scrollable and selectable
- adjust delay in a breeze (`right click` on the subtitle that should be displayed)

### Waveform

- find the exact location to replay (`click` to set replay position, which is indicated by a vertical yellow line, and press `r` to play at that position)

### Offline usable

- onced loaded, can be used without internet next time

## Limitations

- Desktop Chrome only (needs [showOpenFilePicker](https://caniuse.com/?search=showOpenFilePicker) to read local files)
- Video has to be in codecs that browser can play, which means if your video file has an incompatible format you will have to convert it to a compatible one first
- Waveform generation might not be accurate or fail on large file, in which case you can extract audio from video with some other software and select the `Enable using extra audio file` option
